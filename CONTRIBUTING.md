# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
This code of conduct aims to establish a framework of behavior for all collaborators and participants in this project. We promote an environment that fosters quality, collaboration, and mutual respect.

## Commitment to Quality
By participating in this project, each collaborator commits to:

1. **Making Quality Contributions**: Every contribution, whether code, documentation, or any other improvement, should be reviewed and meet the established standards of the project. It is expected that the work presented is well-documented and tested.

2. **Being Responsible**: Take responsibility for your work. Ensure that your contributions do not introduce errors and are functional.

3. **Continuously Improving**: Constantly seek ways to improve not only your own work but also that of the project. Learn from code reviews and seek advice when needed.

## Collaboration
We foster a collaborative environment where all members can contribute effectively:

1. **Clear Communication**: Maintain open and clear communication. Explain your design and development decisions, and don’t hesitate to ask questions if you’re unsure about something.

2. **Accepting and Providing Feedback**: Constructive feedback is essential for growth. Both when receiving and giving feedback, do so respectfully and focused on the work, not the person.

3. **Respecting Others' Time**: Recognize that everyone has different levels of experience and availability. Be considerate in your interactions and in how you ask for help.

## How to Contribute
- **Report Bugs**: If you find a bug, feel free to open an issue to report it.
- **Corrections**: If you wish to fix a bug, you can create a pull request with your changes.
- **Documentation Improvements**: Any improvement in documentation is valuable and appreciated.
- **Ideas**: If you have suggestions or ideas for improving the project, please share them.


## Inclusivity
Our project is open to everyone, and we value diversity:

1. **Creating a Welcoming Environment**: Encourage inclusion and respect for all opinions and perspectives. Everyone should feel comfortable contributing.

2. **Recognizing Others' Contributions**: Value the work and effort of others. Recognition is fundamental to a positive and motivating environment.
   
## Consequences
Violations of this code of conduct may lead to warnings and, in severe cases, expulsion from the project.
